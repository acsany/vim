## Customizing Vim

> ðŸ“„ My .vimrc file can be found here: https://github.com/acsany/dotfiles

When you open Vim for the first time, it looks quite basic. By creating a `.vimrc` file (usually in your home-directory) and adding settings to it, you can customize it entirely.

Basic customizations may be:

```
set number                " show line numbers
```
