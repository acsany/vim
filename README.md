# Getting started with Vim

Repo to document my journey to use Vim. 
Itâ€™s meant to be a personal documentation of the most important steps to get Vim (on Mac) working.

## Notes
On Mac there is a version of Vim installed already. However, it may not me the most current and some things donâ€™t work (e.g. System Clipboard). To get the most current homebrew version of Vim use `brew install vim` resp. `brew upgrade vim`.

If preferred, you can map the Capslock key to ESC: https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Map_caps_lock_to_escape_in_macOS

## Customizing Vim

> ðŸ“„ My .vimrc file can be found here: https://github.com/acsany/dotfiles

When you open Vim for the first time, it looks quite basic. By creating a `.vimrc` file (usually in your home-directory) and adding settings to it, you can customize it entirely.

Basic customizations may be:

```
set number                " show line numbers
set clipboard=unnamed     " use system clipboard

syntax on                 " Syntax highlighting
```

Type `:syntax on` to enable syntax highlighting.


## Commands (Normal Mode)
List of commands that I ~~used~~ had to look up first.
